Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to implement Bankerâ€™s
algorithm. Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results.

O/P

Bankers Algorithm!
Enter the number of processes: 5

Enter the number of resources: 3

Enter the allocated resources for each process: 
0 1 0
2 0 0
3 0 2
2 1 1
0 0 2

Enter the maximum resources for each process: 
7 5 3
3 2 2
9 0 2
2 2 2
4 3 3

Enter the available resources: 3 3 2

The need matrix is: 
7 4 3 
1 2 2 
6 0 0 
0 1 1 
4 3 1 


The system is in safe state and deadlock will not occur!!
The safe state sequence is: P2 P4 P5 P1 P3
